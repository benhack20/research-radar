                        "NOVELTY - The method involves obtaining (100) the touch                gesture executed by the finger through the inertial                measurement unit (IMU) sensor of the intelligent                ring. The touch sound generated is collected (101)                when the finger executes the touch gesture. The                touch gesture and the touch sound generated is                inputted (102) by the touch gesture into the                algorithm processing module, and the surface of the                object touched is identified by the finger by the                algorithm processing module.",
