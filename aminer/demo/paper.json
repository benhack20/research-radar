What did we talk about last time? The advant of augmented reality (AR) glasses, equipped with visual and auditory data capture capabilities, presents a solution. In our work, we implemented an AR Secretary Agent with advanced Large Language Models (LLMs) and Computer Vision technologies. This system could discreetly provide real-time information to the wearer, identifying who they are conversing with and summarizing previous discussions. To verify AR Secretary, we conducted a user study with 13 participants and showed that our technique can efficiently help users to memorize events by up to 20% memory enhancement on our study.",
